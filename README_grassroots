This is a fork of the Bancor master development branch.

In addition to an Grassroots Economics specific migration script for development purposes, it also adds two scripts that seek to make bootstrapping of the development environment easier.


To get started with the development environment, run:

* bash bootstrap.sh
* . start.sh


Then start ganache and run:

* cd solidity
* truffle --network development migrate


Please report bugs to accounts-grassrootseconomics@holbrook.no
