This is a fork of the Bancor master development branch.

In addition to an Grassroots Economics specific migration script for development purposes, it also adds two scripts that seek to make bootstrapping of the development environment easier.


To get started with the development environment, run:

* bash bootstrap.sh
* . start.sh


Then start ganache and run:

* cd solidity
* truffle --network development migrate


In order to be able to add tokens the EtherToken contract will need to be funded. Execute:

* truffle network

Look for section with network id 100, line stating with EtherToken. Send whatever amount of xdai/eth you want in reserve to that address.

There is a file 4_grassroots_fund.js in the migrations directory, skipped by default. Making this step work will remove the need for the above. (strictly speaking, though, that step should probably be performed manually).
